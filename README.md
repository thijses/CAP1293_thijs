# CAP1293_thijs
A library for the CAP1293 touch sensor for atmega328p, ESP32, MSP430 or STM32 (or Wire.h)
(still in development, see TODO list near top of CAP1293_thijs.h for details)
only connectionCheck() function is ready, but registers (and their bits) are defined, and documentation is nearly finished.
